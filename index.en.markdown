Redefining DeFi trading. Creating a more advanced DeFi swap interface with a fair fee distribution system. Uniswap 2.0.

<b>Fee distribution to token holders</b><br>
90% of the fees will be distributed to token holders, 10% will be used for platform upkeep.
100% of the tokens will be sold. No pre-mine or pre-sale. Unsold tokens will be burned. We aim to raise $100K USD.

<b>Injecting into Uniswap liquidity pools</b><br>
Besides bringing in liquidity through curve.market liquidity pools, our matching engine will connect
with the Uniswap liquidity pools and use that as additional liquidity to match orders.

<b>Advanced but friendly UI</b><br>
We will be releasing a more user friendly user interface to bring DeFi to mainstream. Trading on curve.market
will feel like you are using a centralized exchange UI while trading fully decentralized.

<b>curve.market</b> is still at a very early stage but moving fast. For latest updates refer to our social media channels listed below.
