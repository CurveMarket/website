    <h2>Fee distribution.</h2>
    <p>
      90% of the fees will be distributed to token holders, 10% will be
      used for platform upkeep. 97% of the tokens will be sold. 
      Unsold tokens will be burned.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="main-right__mid">
    <h2>Liquidity aggregation.</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge running a trading platform or exchange is maintaining liquidity. 
      StarCurve will function as a DEX aggregator that pools liquidity from multiple DEXes. This will make it possible to use StarCurve as an interface for multiple decentralized exchanges. 
    </p>

<div class="main-right__bottom">
    <h2>Advanced but friendly UI.</h2>
    <p>
      We will be releasing a more user friendly user interface to bring
      DeFi to mainstream. Trading on StarCurve will feel like you are
      using a centralized exchange UI while trading fully decentralized.
